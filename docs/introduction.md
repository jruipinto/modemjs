## Introduction

**Modem.js** born from the need of a node.js library that would help me abstract the communication with a GSM Modem to handle the sending and reception of SMS.

Before starting the development of this package I searched NPM (node package manager) and didn't find any package simple enough that would fit my needs so I got to work and Modem.js born.

**This package is tested with an android phone as GSM Modem** (Samsung GT-S6312 with android version: 4.1.2) but other Modems or android phones may work, very likely.

Later, I may test Modem.js with other phones / gsm modems and make a list of supported / tested equipments (you may contribute too üòÅ).
