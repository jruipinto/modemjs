## Node.js Support

**Modem.js** relies heavilly on **SerialPort** NPM package wich officially supports all Active, Maintenance and Current LTS releases of Node.js. For information on what versions this currently covers see the [Node.js Release Schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule).


## Supported Platforms and Architectures
The platforms, architectures that `serialport` supports are the following;

| Platform / Arch | Supported |
|       ---       | --- |
| Linux / ia32¹   |  ☐  |
| Linux / x64     |  ☑  |
| Linux / ARM v6⁴ |  ☐  |
| Linux / ARM v7⁴ |  ☐  |
| Linux / ARM v8⁴ |  ☐  |
| Linux / MIPSel⁴ |  ☐  |
| Linux / PPC64⁴  |  ☐  |
| OSX / x64³      |  ☑  |
| Windows² / x86  |  ☑  |
| Windows² / x64  |  ☑  |


- ¹ NodeJS has dropped prebuilt binaries for NodeJS 10 and above for 32bit linux. As a result it's too difficult to maintain support. However if you build nodejs and serialport yourself it will probably work.
- ² Windows 7, 8, 10, and 10 IoT are supported, but our CI tests only Windows Server 2012 R2.
- ³ OSX 10.4 Tiger and above are supported, but our CI tests only 10.9.5 Mavericks with Xcode 6.1.
- ⁴ ARM, MIPSel and PPC64¹ platforms are not currently part of our testing or build matrix, but will probably work. Since node 12 MIPSel⁴ and ARM v6⁴ support has been dropped by the official nodejs builds.

## Last known versions for unsupported versions of Node.js

- For Node.js versions `0.10` and `0.12`, the last functioning release was `serialport@4`.
- For Node.js version `4.0`, the last functioning release was `serialport@6`.
