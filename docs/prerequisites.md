## Mandatory

- [NodeJS v12+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed (earlier versions may work but weren't tested)
- GSM Modem connected to serialport (it may be a virtual com port, instead of the old RS232, you know... 😁)

(PS: You may check supported environments [here](https://jruipinto.github.io/modemjs/docs/supported-environments))

## Optional

- Typescript v3+ (earlier versions may work but weren't tested)
- VSCode

(Typescript + VSCode will help you understand and implement the Modem.js library more easily)
